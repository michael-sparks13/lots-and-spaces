Final Project for Map 671: Mapping Westchester County Parking Lots &amp; Open Spaces


## Project Lots And Spaces
Examines Parking Lots and Open Spaces in Westchester County, NY. Westchester is a 450 sq. mile county just a few minutes north of NYC. One million people live there and, if we think about our built environment as a physical manifestation of our vales, the relative amount of parking lots vs. open spaces in Westchester tells us a lot about what we value.
